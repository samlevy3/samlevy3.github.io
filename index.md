I am a software engineer, runner, science fiction reader, amatur cook/baker, and avid podcast lister currently located in Washington DC. 

I am currently working as a software engineer at the United States Digital Corps where I am working at the National Institutes of Health on the new PubMed Central search. 

In the past I've worked as an software engineer at Veeva Systems and interned as a product manager at Microsft. I also worked on a variety of software projects with different nonprofits. I graduated from the University of Washington with a bachelor of science in Computer Science and a minor in Law Societies and Justice.
